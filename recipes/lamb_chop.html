    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>At the first hint of spring, we roll the grill out of the garage, crank up the flames, and toss some lamb chops onto the hot grates. Nothing does more for rich lamb than the smoky, charred flavors of the grill.</p>

    <p>Lamb chops have a distinctively rich and savory flavor, and while they're fancy enough for a dinner party, quick-cooking lamb chops also add variety to weeknight meals.

    These easy lamb chops are rubbed with fresh thyme, seared in a hot skillet, and topped with a decadent pan sauce flavored with dry white wine, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a knob of butter.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>

        <li>6 (6 ounce) lamb chops</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix together onion, vinegar, oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large resealable bag. Add lamb, seal bag, and toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove lamb from marinade and leave any onions on that stick to meat; discard marinade. Wrap exposed ends of bones with aluminum foil to keep them from burning.</li>
        <li>Cook on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
